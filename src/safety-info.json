        {"question": "What is Coronavirus?", "answer": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness."},
        {"question": "Why is COVID-19 called a novel virus?", "answer": "A Novel virus means that the particular virus hasn't been identified anytime prior till now. There are many other coronavirus which have been identified to occur in humans till now which include common ones like 229E and NL63(classified as alpha coronavirus), OC43 and HKU1(classified as beta coronavirus). There were also other coronavirus pandemic like SARS and MERS few years ago which have been eradicated now."},
        {"question": "How does the virus spread?", "answer": "Coronavirus most commonly spreads between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet, or 2 arm lengths). It spreads through respiratory droplets or small particles, such as those in aerosols, produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. It is possible that COVID-19 may spread through the droplets and airborne particles that are formed when a person who has COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. There is growing evidence that droplets and airborne particles can remain suspended in the air and be breathed in by others, and travel distances beyond 6 feet (for example, during choir practice, in restaurants, or in fitness classes). In general, indoor environments without good ventilation increase this risk"}
